                <p>Points are awarded depending on the uniqueness of your password. <br> <br>The categories that your password are checked
                    against include password length, number of upper and lower case letters, how many numbers there are, how many special
                    characters have been used as well as what combination of the forementioned have been combined. Ultimately, the strength 
                    of your password is based on its entropy.<br> <br>
                    Note that password meters are not perfect and can sometimes promote degradation of password strength due to not encouraging randomness.
                    For example, if a hacker knows the strength rules for a password meter, it becomes much easier for them to crack your password.

                <h3>Password Basics</h3>
                <p>
                    A password is typically the <span class = "tooltip" style="margin-left: 0px;">least secure form of authentication
                        <span class = "tooltiptext">Multi-factor authentication is undisputably the strongest approach to account security</span>
                    </span>. However, as they are most commonly used as the first
                    line of defense it is important to ensure that the security of your password is as high as possible.
                </p>

                
                <h3 id = "passwordEntropy">Password Entropy</h3>
                <p>Password entropy is the amount of randomness in a password. It can be used to determine roughly how long it would take for a password to be cracked using brute-force methods.
                    Entropy is calculated in bits, for example, a password with 50 bits of entropy is as strong as a string of 50 randomly
                    chosen bits. The base-2 logarithm of that number is used to calculate the possible number of attempts to crack a password
                    during a brute-force attack. E.g. 50 bits entropy (2^50) = 1,125,899,906,842,624 possible attempts. <br><br> On average, a hacker will only require half of the possible attempts before cracking
                    the password. Take for example, a password of 4 characters with only lower case letters. There are 456,976 possible combinations that the 
                    password could be (26 possible characters so 26^4) with an entropy of <span class = "tooltip"  style = "margin-left:0;">18.80<span class = "tooltiptext">2^18.80 = 456,976</span></span> (log2(26^4)).<br><br> By increasing the password by just one letter, the possible combinations jumps to 11,881,376. From this, we can see that by just increasing the entropy of a password by 1 bit, the possible attempts significantly increases.
                    By understanding this, it becomes clear that the single most important factor when creating a strong password is length. <br><br>
                    Don't be fooled by the size of these numbers though, as computing power increases the number of passwords that can be guessed per second also increases.
                    With the correct equipment, a hacker can test billions of passwords per second. This is why maximizing the character pool is also important (numbers, symbols, upper/lower case). <br><br>
                    People are notoriously bad at creating passwords, with the average password entropy being 40.54 bits.<br> <a href="#strengthSection">Test your password</a> and see how your password compares.

                <h3>How to increase the security of your password</h3>
                <p>
                    Below is a non-extensive list of methods to increase password security:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strong Passwords:</strong> At the very least 8 characters (ideally at least 16), with multiple character types including upper case, lower case, numbers and symbols.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Repetition and Patterns: </b>Try to avoid repetition and patterns. An example
                    of a commonly used pattern is a word, with the first letter being upper case, followed by a number (e.g London2015).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Avoid Common Passwords: </b>Do not use passwords that include pet names, postcodes, birthdays, phone numbers and so on. Any
                    words that can be found in a dictionary should also be avoided. Using foreign words can increase the security.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Regularly change passwords: </b> Passwords should be changed on a regular basis (not to an old password).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Do not reuse passwords: </b>If a website you have an account with gets compromised, your other passwords will remain secure.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Use a passphrase: </b>Pass"WORD" in itself gives the impression that you should use a word. However, using a passphrase 
                    is much more secure (e.g Il0v3ThEPa$$wordTo0lk1t). Passphrases can also be much easier to remember.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Randomness: </b>The more random the better. Increasing randomness will increase the character pool (the variation
                    of upper and lower cases, symbols, numbers, etc) and thus increases the entropy of the password.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Bonus - use a password manager: </b>Remembering multiple passwords can be difficult. Using a password manager
                    can be useful when using multiple passwords.</li>
                </ul>
