                <img src = "images/coin.png" class = "contentIcon">
                <p class = "left">Password entropy relates to the <i>selection process</i> of a password. It esssentially measures what a password <i>could</i> be. It can be used to determine roughly how long it would take for a password to be cracked using brute-force methods.
                    Entropy is calculated in bits, for example, a password with 50 bits of entropy is as strong as a string of 50 randomly
                    chosen bits (e.g. each bit chosen using a coin toss). The base-2 logarithm of that number is used to calculate the possible number of attempts to crack a password
                    during a brute-force attack. E.g. 50 bits entropy (2^50) = 1,125,899,906,842,624 possible attempts. <br><br> On average, a hacker will only require half of the possible attempts before cracking
                    the password. Another way to calculate the possible combinations is to use the pool size. Take for example, a password of 4 characters with only lower case letters. The pool size would be 26
                    as only lower case letters are being used. So (26 ^ 4) means there are 456,976 possible combinations with an entropy of <span class = "tooltip"  style = "margin-left:0;">18.80<span class = "tooltiptext">2^18.80 = 456,976</span></span> (log2(26^4)).<br><br> By increasing the password by just one letter, the possible combinations jumps to 11,881,376. From this, we can see that by just increasing the entropy of a password by 1 bit, the possible attempts significantly increases.
                    By understanding this, it becomes clear that <strong>the single most important factor when creating a strong password is length</strong> not complexity. So yes, size matters. <br><br>
                    Don't be fooled by the size of these numbers though, as compuational power increases the number of passwords that can be guessed per second also increases.
                    Take our earlier examples, a 4 character password with 18.80 bits of entropy at 1 million
                    guesses per second would take 0.46 seconds for the password to be cracked if all guesses were exhausted. The second password with 5 characers and 23.50 bits of entropy would take 11 seconds to be cracked. With the correct equipment, a hacker can potentially test billions or even trillions of passwords per second. So how secure if your password really? This is why maximizing the character pool is also important (numbers, symbols, upper/lower case). <br><br>
                    People are notoriously bad at creating passwords, with the average password entropy being 40.54 bits.<br> <a href="#strengthSection">Test your password</a> and see how your password compares.

                <img src = "images/man.png" class = "contentIcon">
                <p class = "left">Passwords should always be as strong as <i>practically possible</i>. So how much entropy is enough? Well, how long is a piece of string? 
                   The bits of entropy required for a password depends on the threat model of the system of which the password is being created for.
                   There's not much practical use having a 20 character password for your desktop login. However, a 20 character password for say, your online banking
                   doesn't sound like such a bad idea.<br><br>
                   As computational power increases, so will the required bits of entropy. The Password Toolkit uses the following chart to measure password 
                   strength.

                    dictionary attacks are far more succesful. The reason being that humans typically are not good at creating passwords. Dictionary 
                    attacks are a type of precision brute-force attack where passwords are compared against a list of common words, phrases or patterns.<br><br>
                    The best defence against dictionary attacks is to create complex passwords. As dictionary attacks are usually the first line of 
                    attack during password hacking, it is crucial to ensure your passwords are secure. The list below covers some of the key methods when creating
                    a secure password.

                </p>
                <ul class = "left">
                    <li><strong>Strong Passwords:</strong> At the very least 8 characters (ideally at least 16), with multiple character types including upper case, lower case, numbers and symbols.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Repetition and Patterns: </b>Try to avoid repetition and patterns. An example
                    of a commonly used pattern is a word, with the first letter being upper case, followed by a number (e.g London2015).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Avoid Common Passwords: </b>Do not use passwords that include pet names, postcodes, birthdays, phone numbers and so on. Any
                    words that can be found in a dictionary should also be avoided. Using words foreign to your own language can also increase the security.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Regularly change passwords: </b> Passwords should be changed on a regular basis (not to an old password).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Do not reuse passwords: </b>If a website you have an account with gets compromised, your other passwords will remain secure.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Use a passphrase: </b>Pass"WORD" in itself gives the impression that you should use a word. However, using a passphrase 
                    is much more secure (e.g Il0v3ThEPa$$wordTo0lk1t). Passphrases can also be much easier to remember.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Randomness: </b>The more random the better. Increasing randomness will increase the character pool (the variation
                    of upper and lower cases, symbols, numbers, etc) and thus increases the entropy of the password.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Bonus - use a password manager: </b>Remembering multiple passwords can be difficult. Using a password manager
                    can be useful when using multiple passwords.</li>
                </ul>
